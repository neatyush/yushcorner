      heading: "Basic Principles of Pairing",
      note: `
- Match weight with weight: Light wines with light dishes, bold wines with hearty meals.
- Consider acidity: High-acid wines (like Sauvignon Blanc) pair well with acidic dishes (like tomato-based sauces).
- Balance sweetness: Sweet wines like Riesling pair nicely with spicy food.
- Match or contrast flavors: Either mirror the flavor (e.g., earthy wine with mushrooms) or contrast (e.g., salty food with sweet wine).
- Tannins and protein: Tannic red wines (Cabernet Sauvignon) work well with red meats.

      note: `
- When in doubt, go local: Regional food and local wines often match naturally.
- Taste and adjust: Always taste test your pairings.
- Personal preference matters: Use guidelines, but trust your own taste.
- Think about the sauce: Pair based on the dominant sauce, not just the protein.
